I am an assistant professor at the Department of  Mathematics and Statistics at Washington State University. I am a statistician by training, and I work on the development and analysis of statistical methods for high dimensional data under non standard formulations, such as high dimensional dynamic models characterized via change points, error-in-variables models, missing data structures.  I am also interested in machine learning applications such as unsupervised classification of imaging data.  I received a Ph.D. in Statistics (2015) from the Department of Statistics and Probability at Michigan State University.  I have also worked as a research fellow at the Biostatistics and Computational Biology branch of NIEHS (NIH).  Here is my resume and following is my contact information
