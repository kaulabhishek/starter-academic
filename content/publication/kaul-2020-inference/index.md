abstract: We study a plug in least squares estimator for the change point parameter
  where change is in the mean of a high dimensional random vector under subgaussian
  or subexponential distributions. We obtain sufficient conditions under which this
  estimator possesses sufficient adaptivity against plug in estimates of mean parameters
  in order to yield an optimal rate of convergence $O_p(ξ^-2)$ in the integer scale.
  This rate is preserved while allowing high dimensionality as well as a potentially
  diminishing jump size $ξ,$ provided $słog (pěe T)=o(√(Tl_T))$ or $słog^3/2(pě T)=o(√(Tl_T))$
  in the subgaussian and subexponential cases, respectively. Here $s,p,T$ and $l_T$
  represent a sparsity parameter, model dimension, sampling period and the separation
  of the change point from its parametric boundary, respectively. Moreover, since
  the rate of convergence is free of $s,p$ and logarithmic terms of $T,$ it allows
  the existence of limiting distributions under high dimensional asymptotics. These
  distributions are then derived as the ıt argmax of a two sided negative drift Brownian
  motion or a two sided negative drift random walk under vanishing and non-vanishing
  jump size regimes, respectively, thereby allowing inference on the change point
  parameter. Feasible algorithms for implementation of the proposed methodology are
  provided. Theoretical results are supported with monte-carlo simulations.
