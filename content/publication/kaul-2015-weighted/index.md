abstract: Standard formulations of prediction problems in high dimension regression
  models assume the availability of fully observed covariates and sub-Gaussian and
  homogeneous model errors. This makes these methods inapplicable to measurement errors
  models where covariates are unobservable and observations are possibly non sub-Gaussian
  and heterogeneous. We propose a weighted penalized corrected quantile estimator
  for regression parameters in linear regression models with additive measurement
  errors, where unobservable covariate is nonrandom. The proposed estimators forgo
  the need for the above mentioned model assumptions. We study these estimators in
  a high dimensional sparse setup where the dimensionality can grow exponentially
  with the sample size. We provide bounds for the statistical error associated with
  the estimation, that hold with asymptotic probability 1, thereby providing the $ell_1$-consistency
  of the proposed estimator. We also establish the model selection consistency in
  terms of the correctly estimated zero components of the parameter vector. A simulation
  study that investigates the finite sample accuracy of the proposed estimator is
  also included in the paper.
