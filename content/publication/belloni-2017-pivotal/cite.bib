 abstract = {We propose a new estimator for the high-dimensional linear regression model with observation error in the design where the number of coefficients is potentially larger than the sample size. The main novelty of our procedure is that the choice of penalty parameters is pivotal. The estimator is based on applying a self-normalization to the constraints that characterize the estimator. Importantly, we show how to cast the computation of the estimator as the solution of a convex program with second order cone constraints. This allows the use of algorithms with theoretical guarantees and reliable implementation. Under sparsity assumptions, we derive $\ell_q$-rates of convergence and show that consistency can be achieved even if the number of regressors exceeds the sample size. We further provide a simple to implement rule to threshold the estimator that yields a provably sparse estimator with similar $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-rates of convergence. The thresholds are data-driven and component dependents. Finally, we also study the rates of convergence of estimators that refit the data based on a selected support with possible model selection mistakes. In addition to our finite sample theoretical results that allow for non-i.i.d. data, we also present simulations to compare the performance of the proposed estimators.},
