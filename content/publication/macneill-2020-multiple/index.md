abstract: The “Bayes‐type” method of deriving change‐point test statistics was introduced
  by Chernoff and Zacks (1964). Other authors subsequently adapted this approach and
  derived Bayes‐type statistics for at most one change (AMOC), and for multiple change
  points, under a variety of model formulations. Asymptotic distribution theory has
  always been limited to the AMOC statistics because of the perceived complexity of
  multiple change‐point statistics. In this article, it is shown that the Bayes‐type
  statistic derived to test for multiple change points is directly proportional to
  the AMOC statistic. This result immediately provides distributional results for
  Bayes‐type multiple change‐point statistics. In addition, it fundamentally alters
  the current understanding of the AMOC statistic. It follows from this result that
  the Bayes‐type statistic derived under AMOC conditions in fact tests for at least
  one change (ALOC), even though the statistic is derived under AMOC formulation.
  Under asymptotic consideration, the result also extends to the case of model errors
  following a stationary process. As an example, the classical Nile River data are
  revisited and analyzed for the presence of multiple change points.
