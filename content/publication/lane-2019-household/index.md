abstract: "Objectives Establishment and development of the infant gastrointestinal\
  \ microbiome (GIM) varies cross‐culturally and is thought to be influenced by factors\
  \ such as gestational age, birth mode, diet, and antibiotic exposure. However, there\
  \ is little data as to how the composition of infants' households may play a role,\
  \ particularly from a cross‐cultural perspective. Here, we examined relationships\
  \ between infant fecal microbiome (IFM) diversity/composition and infants' household\
  \ size, number of siblings, and number of other household members.  Materials and\
  \ methods We analyzed 377 fecal samples from healthy, breastfeeding infants across\
  \ 11 sites in eight different countries (Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Peru,\
  \ Spain, Sweden, and the United States). Fecal microbial community structure was\
  \ determined by amplifying, sequencing, and classifying (to the genus level) the\
  \ V1–V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Surveys administered to infants'\
  \ mothers identified household members and composition.  Results Our results indicated\
  \ that household composition (represented by the number of cohabitating siblings\
  \ and other household members) did not have a measurable impact on the bacterial\
  \ diversity, evenness, or richness of the IFM. However, we observed that variation\
  \ in household composition categories did correspond to differential relative abundances\
  \ of specific taxa, namely: Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella.\
  \  Discussion This study, to our knowledge, is the largest cross‐cultural study\
  \ to date examining the association between household composition and the IFM. Our\
  \ results indicate that the social environment of infants (represented here by the\
  \ proxy of household composition) may influence the bacterial composition of the\
  \ infant GIM, although the mechanism is unknown. A higher number and diversity of\
  \ cohabitants and potential caregivers may facilitate social transmission of beneficial\
  \ bacteria to the infant gastrointestinal tract, by way of shared environment or\
  \ through direct physical and social contact between the maternal–infant dyad and\
  \ other household members. These findings contribute to the discussion concerning\
  \ ways by which infants are influenced by their social environments and add further\
  \ dimensionality to the ongoing exploration of social transmission of gut microbiota\
  \ and the “old friends” hypothesis."
