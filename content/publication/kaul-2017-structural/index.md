abstract: This paper is motivated by the recent interest in the analysis of high-dimensional
  microbiome data. A key feature of these data is the presence of “structural zeros”
  which are microbes missing from an observation vector due to an underlying biological
  process and not due to error in measurement. Typical notions of missingness are
  unable to model these structural zeros. We define a general framework which allows
  for structural zeros in the model and propose methods of estimating sparse high-dimensional
  covariance and precision matrices under this setup. We establish error bounds in
  the spectral and Frobenius norms for the proposed estimators and empirically verify
  them with a simulation study. The proposed methodology is illustrated by applying
  it to the global gut microbiome data of Yatsunenko and others (2012. Human gut microbiome
  viewed across age and geography. Nature 486, 222–227). Using our methodology we
  classify subjects according to the geographical location on the basis of their gut
  microbiome.
